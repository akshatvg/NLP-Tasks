For my money, memorable disagree F ments often centre on food. A friend who was about to settle abroad was feeling particularly wistful about a storied south Bombay restaurant. the kind of eatery that locals like to call "overrated" and guidebook-toting tourists faithfully make a beeline for. His favourite on the menu? The baklava-a dry fruit-laden traditional sweet that smacked of decadence in every bite.
