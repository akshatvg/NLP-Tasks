I like a bit of pow-wow in any place. Let me rephrase before you think I am eternally hankering for a fight. What I mean is I would choose crooked streets over straight highways, sweaty mayhem over pristine elegance. This is why no matter where I go in this world, coming home to India, and especially Bombay, is never dull blame growing up in the city for my pugilistic predilection. One of the many descriptors that Mark Twain used in relation to Bombay was "pow-wow." The place seemed to confound him: "Bewitching". "Bewildering", "Enchanting", "Arabian Nights come again?" the man was repulsed and riveted at the same time. It was a place befitting the number of exclamations he used."
