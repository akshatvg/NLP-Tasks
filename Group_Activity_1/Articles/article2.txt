Our year end edition toasts ultra indulgence while travelling, featuring itineraries that many will know to be out of their financial reach. In producing these narratives, I was struck by a contrast. Travel today is dominated by minimalists or downsizers, those who preach the gospel of "hard-knock wanderlust." And they almost always reap universal admiration. They are characters to aspire to, examples of made for-Instagram sayings such as, "All you need is a backpack" or "#MotorcycleDiaries." Unable to join these gallivanting philosophers others marvel at their brave rebellion-oh, to give up the predictability of overpriced tourism traps someday, they sigh.
